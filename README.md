# RemindMeBot

## **Project Description and Motivation**

This project was an attempt to use the Discord API in conjunction with a database system (MySQL) to develop an application in which a user can create alerts for some time in the future which are then recalled by the bot at the specified time.

The project was developed collaboratively by the two contributors, in an attempt to devleop our understanding and experience with technologies ww had not previously used. Both contributions partook equally in the development project, development was on an individual and peer-programming basis. This project was entirely coded during a 1-week period, this was our self-assigned timeframe. which was our given constraint.
